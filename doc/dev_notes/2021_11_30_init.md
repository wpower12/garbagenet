Didn't write a note last time i worked on this. whoops. 

## Catch up
the wiki tables weren't actually uniform, so, oof.

Found a new thing on reddit: [wikiql](https://github.com/zverok/wikipedia_ql).

## WikiQL

This lets you write some queries to access content on pages. Should switch to using this to access the seasons, and then contestants. This should make it easier to mine different relationships, too. 

## Working-ish
In the 03 script I have a combo of wikiQL and beautifulsoup parsing that seems to work. Some of the seasons have to be skipped because they don't have full wiki pages. 

Just need to add the actual neo4j stuff next. 

I think the annoying part will be getting the info out of the json blob that the wikiql returns. Its not a python dict? idk. Have to look into it.

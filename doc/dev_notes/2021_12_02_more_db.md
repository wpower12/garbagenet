# 2021-12-02 more db

Trying to get the new query results into the db. 

Might throw it in a module now? just a single method. 

## Main and Paradise Seasons Gathered?
So thats working? The main and paradise seasons are now in the neo4j db. 

![garbagenet v0.1](../imgs/initial_net.png)

Pretty happy with that? 

## NOTE - The 'Missing' seasons
You have to remove seasons 3,4,6,7,8 of the og seasons. My wife has an explanation and its... long.

## Next Steps
I'd like to make sure the various uniqueness conditions are being respected. I am worried that 'single word names' might be causing conflicts. It'd be nice to find the best practice way of dealing with various kinds of unique-ness constraints in neo4j. 

I'd like to start writing this up in a more 'guide'/blogpost kind of way, too. Make it have sections mapping to the various concepts in the neo4j toolkit, and try to mirror the flow and structure of the og neo tutorials. Basically, make the flow follow those tutorials, but the focus/examples are an evolution of a garbagenet database. 

This would also require front matter for the scraping part. For that, you'd have to cover (at least quickly), both beautiful soup scraping, and using the newly released wikiql toolkit (need to make it clear that it's experimental).

## IDEA - Structure Changes
I'd like to make it so the scripts work on a pandas dataframe, or some arbitrary collection of seasons/players. That way the 'guide' document can be structured as follows:

* Overview
* Guide for Scraping
	- Reading wikimedia data
	- Turning it into dataframe (even better, just csv's?)
* Guide for neo4j 
	- use the dataframe/csv-s to build the db
	- then cover various neo4j queries we can make against it

If we include the raw csv files in the repo, we could then allow users to decide if they want to skip the first guide or not. If you just want to learn neo4j with a interesting dataset, then just use the csvs. With the code structured like this, it wont matter to me. 

Should start with a barebanes outline of what concepts in neo I want to cover, beyond the basics of creating, matching, merging, etc. Again, just follow the og tutorial. 

## Working on projections
Theres a plugin that adds a bunch of algorithms to the available tools provided in the neo4j environment. We can use them during queries to create graphs that are projections of nodes over certain relationships.

Working off of the documentation here: [Neo4j Graph Data Science Algorithms Docs](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/introduction/).

Installed the plugin for it through the interface on the neo4j desktop app. 

Working on the query for creating a projection of first the people over the show/season nodes, and then see if i can do a projection of a subset of the shows to the rest of the shows, 'through' the people nodes. 

I think the following does something close enough for my purposes. This will find shows connected by the same player, count the number of players that connect those two shows, and then create a new edge, with a weight equal to that number of players. We can then query on that relationship to build a view of the graph thats equivalent to the show-show projection over the show-player relationships.

```neo4j
MATCH (s1:Show)<-[r:STARRED|COMPETED]-(p:Player)-[r2:STARRED|COMPETED]->(s2:Show)
WHERE id(s1) < id(s2)
WITH s1, s2, count(p) as weight
MERGE (s1)-[:COMMON_SEASONS {common_seasons:weight}]->(s2)
RETURN s1, s2, weight
```

Need to check the merge syntax. Wish I could make that symetric? but I cant? I think I can just take the WHERE clause off? 

Then you can get the 'projection' with the following.

```neo4j
MATCH (s:Show)-[r:COMMON_SEASONS]->(s2)
WHERE r.common_seasons >= 2
RETURN s, s2
```

Could then figure out how to filter it so only paradise seasons are shown.

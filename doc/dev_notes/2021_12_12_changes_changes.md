# 2021-12-12 - Changing to 2 Steps

Ok so goal is to split the project into two main parts:

* Data Mining Wikipedia
* Creating Neo4j Database Model

Eventually I want to map this to various respectable resources to make this not a pile of hacks, but before then; lets make a working pile of hacks and take some notes so we have a starting point.

At this point that just means turning this into a set of scripts that write a common data format to a csv, and then read that to make the database.

Could introduce pandas? Idk.

Gotta start the bare bones outlines of a document, too.
